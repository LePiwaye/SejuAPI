# RiotPHP
![alt text](https://gitlab.com/Piwaye/RiotPHP/badges/master/build.svg "Current build status")

A simple yet flexible implementation of League of Legends API in PHP.

This implementation is not endorsed or maintained by Riot Games. I maintain it on my free time, so it might become 
crashy or unusable if something changes from Riot's side and I'm not aware of that.


## Documentation :

You can find the documentation on [https://riotphp.piwaye.fr](https://riotphp.piwaye.fr), written in broken english with a lot of bad jokes.
